# unsw_18_best
The dataset is UNSW_2018_IoT_Botnet_Final_10_best, which is a benchmark dataset created by UNSW.
The original UNSW_2018_IoT_Botnet dataset is too big for CPU running. Thus, the UNSW_2018_IoT_Botnet_Final_10_best is chosen for training. Five classic models in sklearn package are used for training.
